        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        I know I said letters are manipulative- and I stand by that! But old habits, y'know? I couldn't 
        let the actual big goodbye go without writing at least a liiiiiiiitle something.
        <p></p>
        Originally, this was a page going through our entire relationship, from freshman year to now. There were pictures 
        of us from every year. Interspersed was my commentary, looking back at our relationship with rose-tinted glasses and thinking about how we grew up together, have known each other 
        for so long, etc. Then, at the very end, I re-read it and just... got sad? I mean, it's just dishonest to look at our relationship in the long term and think it was ever a happy story. There's so much baggage and anger, 
        so many mistakes (my mistakes), so much that just gets skipped over, so much that we both choose to ignore. It made me feel gross to look at the pictures of us from freshman year, captioned with things like 
        "we were so young and happy", when that might have been the cruelest I've ever been to another human being. 
        <p></p>
        To try and y'know, not do that, I'm leaving this open-ended right now. I want to talk to you tonight about serious things, BEFORE doing this. I don't want to be manipulative, intentionally or not. 
        I don't want to do some big romantic display that will just be fueling our mutual personality disorders. Maybe that's the wrong thing to do, I honestly don't know. I guess we'll find out.
