      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For the final project of CS 3410, we were given groups
        and tasked with simulating the performance of different
        cache designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal was to use C to simulate the behavior of
        different caches, with the goal of seeing the benefits
        and downsides of the designs under different use needs.
        (i.e. large caches w/ set-associative design, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We simulated single-core & multi-core designs,
        under both direct-mapped, and set-associative
        organization, measuring their hit rates as well as
        writebacks, snooping, and upgrade misses.
